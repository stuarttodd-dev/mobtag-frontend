<p><strong>Sunnerg</strong> is a General Contractor and Service Provider specializing in the design and implementation of major B2B projects in the Renewable Energy market.</p>

<p>Delivering projects in the UK as well as internationally, the UK Construction Manager recognized the advantage of tracking critical test and commissioning records during construction, as well as final as-built records for their clients using the Mobtag system.</p>

<p>The QR tags supplied by DOTgroup, attached to the Solar PV ground mount systems, provided local, instant access to key documents at the point of use. This helped Sunnerg save time and reduce risk, with three sites adopting the system in quick succession during Q4 2024 and Q1 2025.</p>
